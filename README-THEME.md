# Maps
- The progression of episode 1 will probably go like: Streets, gradually to an evil corporation's HQ. It happens in New York, in the winter.
- The enemies should start to not be humanoid when you enter the HQ portion of it (Around E1M4).
- Levels start and end with portals (look at E1M1's end for example).

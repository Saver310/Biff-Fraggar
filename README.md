## BIFF FRAGGAR'S LIBRE ADVENTURE

Biff Fraggar is a project to make a FOSS replacement for the Ultimate Doom and Doom 2 IWADs, in a similar vein to Freedoom, but without a focus on compatibility or replacement, and moreso just to make a standalone libre game.

### Building

On Windows, you can place your Deutex installation in the /deutex/WINDOWS folder (make sure deutex.exe is in that directory) and run ``build.bat``.

On Linux, you can run ``build.sh``, assuming you have Deutex installed via package manager or a Makefile. If you can run ``deutex`` without going to the binary, it's installed.

There are separate scripts for building the DOOM 2 compatible version of Biff Fraggar.

### Licenses

Biff Fraggar's assets are licensed under the GPL, with use of BSD and CC0 licensed assets. See CONTRIBUTORS for a list of volunteers.
The project makes use of Freedoom's DEUTEX tree as a basis.
